# kin
A small tool I made for making Starter Templates for projects.
I'm new to C, so the source code may not be the greatest.
But it works fine nonetheless.

# How To Install?
You can download the binaries from this repo.

If you want to compile from source, there's a makefile provided for you.
This is the file your going need to compile the source code.
You can use any compiler you like, but GNU/GCC is recommended.
Once you have everything set up, you can start using the program.

# How To Use?
There are three command flags for kin, right now.

They are listed right here:
*  -c [project name]        C Project
*  -py [project name]       Python Project
*  -web [project name]      HTML 5 Project
