# kin
A small tool I made for making Starter Templates for projects.
I'm new to C, so the source code may not be the greatest.
But it works fine nonetheless.

# How To Install?
You can download the binaries from this repo.

If you want to compile from source, your going to need a few things.
In the source code, theres a "build.bat" or "build.sh".
This is the file your going need to compile the source code.
You can use any compiler you like, but GNU/GCC is recommended.
Once you have everything set up, you can run the build file and it will automatically compile for you.

# How To Use?
There are three command flags for kin, right now.

They are listed right here:
*  -c [project name] C Project
*  -py [project name] Python Project
*  -web [project name] HTML 5 Project
